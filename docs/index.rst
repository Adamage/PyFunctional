PyFunctional Documentation
=============================

`PyFunctional` is a library for creating data pipelines and analysis in an easy and accessible
way. It is primarily inspired by the APIs from
`Apache Spark RDDs <http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#transformations>`_,
`Scala Collections <http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.AbstractSeq>`_,
and `Microsoft LINQ <https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/101-LINQ-Samples-3fb9811b>`_.

Documentation
-------------
The best place to see examples of `PyFunctional` usage is on the project's github readme page
at `github.com/EntilZha/PyFunctional <https://github.com/EntilZha/PyFunctional>`_. The
docs on this site are primarily meant to give comprehensive documentation of every public
function and API in `PyFunctional`. Its secondary purpose is to document internal methods to make
development easier for maintainers and contributors.
